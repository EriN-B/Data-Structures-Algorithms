# Algorithms and Data Structures in TypeScript

This repository contains my personal implementations of various algorithms and data structures, written in TypeScript. It also includes my solutions to selected problems from LeetCode. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures, while also getting proficient in TypeScript.

## Contents

- **Algorithms:** Classic algorithms implemented in TypeScript, such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.
- **Data Structures:** Implementation of fundamental data structures like linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and graphs.
- **LeetCode Solutions:** My solutions to various LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty and problem type.
